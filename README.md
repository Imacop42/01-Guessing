# 01-Guessing
this is my first project for MSCH C-220, a guessing game. It is set up with story elements to give a setting for the game and make it seem more alive.
The player is asked to guess a number between 1-50, with feedback given based on if the number was too low, too high, or correct. there are even different feedback options for how well you performed. ( 1st try is astounding, 6 and under is impressive, 7-9 is satisfactory, 10+ is 'not very good'.)
